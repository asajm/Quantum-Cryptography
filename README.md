# Breaking RSA: An Implementation of Shor's Algorithm in Quantum Cryptography

## Introduction
This project explores the implementation of Shor's Algorithm, a quantum algorithm for integer factorization developed by Peter Shor in 1994. It has significant implications for cryptography, particularly for systems like RSA that rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.

## Implementation Details
The code involves building a controlled U Gate, identifying qubit lengths, determining accepted values, and building the quantum circuit using Qiskit library.

### Dependencies
- Qiskit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Sympy

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to understand the step-by-step implementation of Shor's algorithm.

## Example
An example with N=143 and a=2 is provided, demonstrating the steps of the algorithm and its potential to factor large numbers used in RSA encryption.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of quantum computing in breaking RSA encryption, highlighting the need for quantum-resistant cryptography.
